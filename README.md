# MinGW Distro: [nuwen.net/mingw.html](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html)

Here are the build scripts for my MinGW distro.

You'll need to run them in MSYS2, which you can set up without an installer:

* Go to: https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/tag/nightly-x86_64
* Download: `msys2-base-x86_64-latest.tar.xz`
* Extract it to: `E:\Temp\msys64`
  + You can choose a different location.
* Run: `msys2_shell.cmd`
* Restart MSYS2 if you're instructed to.
* In MSYS2, repeatedly run `pacman -Syuu` until you see:
  ```
  :: Synchronizing package databases...
   clangarm64 is up to date
   mingw32 is up to date
   mingw64 is up to date
   ucrt64 is up to date
   clang32 is up to date
   clang64 is up to date
   msys is up to date
  :: Starting core system upgrade...
   there is nothing to do
  :: Starting full system upgrade...
   there is nothing to do
  ```
* In MSYS2, run: `pacman -Su cmake diffutils m4 make nasm ninja patch tar texinfo mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-rust`
* You can customize the terminal's appearance with **Right Click > Options...**. I prefer:
  + Text: Consolas, 16pt
  + Window: 120 Columns, 50 Rows

## Important Notes

The build scripts assume that:

* `C:\MinGW` contains the previous version of the distro.
  + This assumption is centralized in `0_append_distro_path.sh`, where it says `export X_DISTRO_ROOT=/c/mingw`.
* `E:\Temp\gcc` is usable as a working directory.
  + This assumption is centralized in `0_append_distro_path.sh`, where it says `export X_WORK_DIR=/e/temp/gcc`.
* The build scripts live next to the sources, *not* directly within `E:\Temp\gcc`.
  + I put the build scripts and the sources into `E:\Temp\gcc\sources-VERSION`.

I **highly** recommend that you execute each build script **by hand** before attempting to run it in one shot.
